# From-a-Concrete-Jungle-to-Conrete-Farm

Collaborated with a team on a Big Data project to predict the distribution of vertical farms across New York City
Implemented a Big Data cleaning, profiling, and preprocessing pipeline using Hadoop Map-Reduce and Impala
Performed in-depth data analysis in Python to develop a suitability score metric along with data visualizations using ArcGIS that indicated the region-wise distribution of vertical farms
The predicted distributions matched the Supermarket Needs Index(SNI) with 94.28% accuracy
